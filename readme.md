## About Us

We are currently connected with a WhatsApp community of other educators and learners in Gaza and the West Bank. Given the limited volunteer hours, we aim for efforts that are intentionally designed to be manageable, sustainable, and discreet. 

We aim to provide **practical, timely support** to marginalized children
- Sharing STEAM educational resources that can be useful to local educators
- Offering them free Zoom sessions through our English empowerment program

We also connect advocates from around the world through unfunded research initiatives.

## Beyond 2025 - Hopes and dreams

### Scale-up English tutorials 

- Focus on conversational English 
- Design modularized curricular to facilitate Zoom lessons:
    - Offline homework
    - Trauma-coping strategies via use of colors, arts, crafts, sketches, paired readings of picture books 

### Virtual cocreation workshop

- To host a second (virtual or in-person) workshop 

### Translation + image captioning + cultural preservation projects

- Details coming soon

### Empowering non-Palestanians through other social good projects

- Combating inequity through AI-assisted interventions
- We invite interested researchers to co-develop mobile apps for marginalized communities with us
