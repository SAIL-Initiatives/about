## About Us

We are connected to a WhatsApp-based community of educators and learners across Gaza and the West Bank. Given constrained resources and volunteer capacity, we intentionally design initiatives that are **manageable, sustainable, and discreet**.

Our focus is on delivering **practical, timely support** to marginalized children by:
- Sharing STEAM educational resources that local educators can readily use
- Offering free Zoom-based English learning sessions through our English Empowerment Program

In parallel, we connect global advocates and researchers through **unfunded, community-driven research initiatives** that prioritize ethical collaboration and real-world impact.

## 2026 & Beyond
