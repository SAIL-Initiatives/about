## About Us

Our group aims to provide **practical, timely support** to marginalized children
— Sharing STEAM educational resources that can be useful to local educators*
- Offering them free Zoom English tutorials

We also invite interested researchers to co-develop mobile apps for marginalized communities with us.

We are currently connected with a WhatsApp community of other educators and learners in Gaza and the West Bank. Given the limited volunteer hours, we aim for efforts that are intentionally designed to be manageable, sustainable, and discreet. 


## Beyond 2025 - Hopes and dreams
